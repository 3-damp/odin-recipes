    <h4>Baked BBQ Chicken</h4>

    <p>The times given are for my oven settings. Times and temperature 
       can vary from oven to oven so adjust accordingly. Can also be grilled 
       but you have to attend to them and add sauce more often = more work. </p>

    <p>You can use boneless breasts also but they have a tendency to turn out dry. 
       Adjust cooking times if you do use boneless breasts. You can use any prepared or homemade BBQ sauce 
       you prefer. </p>



     <h4>Ingredients</h4>
     <ul>
         <li>4 whole skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts</li>
         <li>1 cup barbecue sauce (your choice)</li>
         <li>kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>   
         <ol>
             <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with heavy-duty foil to make cleanup easier.</li>
             <li>Prepare chicken breasts by cutting off the rib meat if you wish and rinse and pat dry. Leave the skin on. Season chicken with salt and pepper and put in the pan.</li>
             <li>Bake in the preheated oven until juices start to appear, about 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove the pan and generously pour 1/2 of the barbecue sauce over chicken. Continue to bake for 20 minutes. Repeat with remaining barbecue sauce and cook until no longer pink in the centers and skin is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
